## Linear Regression model using Normal Equation & Scikit-Learn library.

This pet-project is to build a Linear Regression model by 2 ways:
1. Using normal equation (not using and ML library).
2. using Scikit-Learn library.

The data from the Olympics is used to implement our algorithm.
The aim is trying to predict how many medals a country will earn based on how many athletes it enters into the Olympics.
